# Toonder

### Description

We had one week to complete our third project of the course, and in a team of three, we decided to get a little creative and build a dating app for cartoons! The app lets users create an account and profile, swipe to like or dislike other profiles, and see their matches.

### Brief

For this group project, we were tasked with building a full-stack application, developing both the front and backend using React. Our database was stored in MongoDB, and we needed to create a MERN app with full CRUD functionality. The project also required us to focus on a visually appealing design and deploy the app online to ensure it was publicly accessible.

- The back-end application is built with Express and Node.
- The front-end application is built with React.
- MongoDB is used as the database management system.
- The back-end and front-end applications implement JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users.
- Authorization is implemented across the front-end and back-end. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The project has at least two data entities in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The project has full CRUD functionality on both the back-end and front-end.
- The front-end application does not hold any secret keys. Public APIs that require secret keys must be accessed from the back-end application.
- The project is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.
